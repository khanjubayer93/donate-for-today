                <h2>Food For A Family</h2>
                <p>Safe food and water supplies are a major concern following a natural disaster such as a tornado,
                    flood, hurricane or
                    blizzard. Texas families who live in disaster-prone areas may benefit from being prepared in the
                    event of disaster.
                    Knowing how to safely handle food and water in the immediate few days after the disaster can reduce
                    stress, worry and
                    inconvenience.</p>

                <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>Is your area prone to flooding or did you hear about floods in nearby areas? Floods are the most
                    costly and common form
                    of natural disaster in the United States. Floods occur when heavy or frequent rains saturate the
                    ground. Bodies of water
                    can swell and overflow, causing floods. Know what to do when a flood is likely in your area.</p>

                <h2>Education for a child</h2>
                <p>Flooding is one of the most dangerous, destructive, and deadly natural disasters that can occur. They
                    can happen
                    anywhere, and at any time, for a variety of reasons. Flood-related deaths are common, usually due to
                    lack of proper
                    preparation and nonexistent safety protocols. As difficult as it may be for adults to remain safe
                    during a flood event,
                    it is even more so for children.</p>
